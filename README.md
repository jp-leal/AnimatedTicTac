A very basic game, but using animation. A few functions in the app bring the functionalities such as the game logic, the app checks for a winner after each move and display an alert when a playe wins, or if the game ends in a tie. The restarts functionality is also added through a function and the player can restart the game after it ends tapping the "Play Again"Button

The app checks for winning conditions, horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
